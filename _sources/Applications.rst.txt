Applications
=============
**Copper** was developed with building energy code development and adoption in mind, and has been used by and integrated in different applications. Examples of such applications include:

* `Total System Performance Ratio (TSPR) analysis tool`_: The TSPR is a way to derive a global HVAC system coefficient performance measure that can be used to establish compliance by comparing it to a baseline building design TSPR. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has developed an analysis tool to enable jurisdictions to use the TSPR approach for building energy code compliance. **Copper** is used by the TSPR analysis tool to generate chiller performance curves for baseline and user models.
* `Addendum bd to ASHRAE Standard 90.1`_: **Copper** was used to generate sets of performance curves for chillers to be used in a baseline chilled water plant model in two performance-based approaches defined in the standard.
