Documentation for **Copper**
==================================

**Version**: |release|

**Copper** is a building energy simulation performance curve generator for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning equipment. It uses a genetic algorithm to modify existing performance curves or a set of aggregated existing performance curves to match specific design characteristics including full and part load energy performance metric values.

**Copper** generates performance curves that can be used in most common building energy software tools such as `EnergyPlus`_ and `DOE-2`_.

You might be interested in **Copper** if you are an energy modeler, engineer, or researcher wanting to generate simulation-ready performance curves that match a set of specific design characteristics and efficiencies.
